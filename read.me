A particular problem that I want to solve with coding; that would be to produce and distribute a final fantasy themed homage game.
I figure there have to be plenty of game players like myself who are perfectly comfortable with the way games were in the 90s and
would just as well prefer to play games that don't rely on fancy graphics, online or multiplayer options, but instead just want to
play games that remind them of their teenage years.
